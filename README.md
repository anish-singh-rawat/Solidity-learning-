# Solidity Learning Journey 🚀

## 📅 Duration
**Start Date:** 15th June  
**End Date:** 30th July  
**Total:** 45 Days  

## 🎯 Objective
This repository is dedicated to **Solidity learning** over a focused 45-day period.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation in Solidity smart contract development through consistent daily learning and hands-on coding.

## 📚 Topics to Cover
- Basics of Solidity
- Smart Contract Syntax
- Data Types and Functions
- Inheritance and Modifiers
- Events and Error Handling
- ERC-20 and ERC-721 Standards
- Security Best Practices
- Gas Optimization
- Testing and Deployment
- Integration with Frontend

## 📝 Progress Tracking
Daily learning, code snippets, project files, and notes will be added to this repository.

## ✅ Milestones
- [ ] Week 1: Solidity Basics & Smart Contract Structure
- [ ] Week 2: Data Types, Functions & Conditionals
- [ ] Week 3: Intermediate Concepts & Projects
- [ ] Week 4: ERC Standards, Security & Gas Optimization
- [ ] Week 5: Testing, Deployment & Integration

**Let's stay consistent and hit the target! 💪**

# 1st week reading...


**Basic Data types**


## Integer data type 
- use uint and int data type in our project.

## Bool data type 
- use Bool data type

## Address data type 
- use to save or store the contract or wallet address




## Reference data types

**Strings**

**Arrays**

**Mapping**

**Struct**



## Data Location

**Memory**
- lifetime is limited to an external function call.

**Storage**
- the location where the state variables are stored, where the lifetime is limited to the lifetime of a contract.

**Call data**
- special data location the contains the function arguments.



## Daily usefull keywords

**View**
- whenever we are reading the state variable we write this view keyword.


**Pure**
- whenever reading or writing in local variable on that time we use it.


**No Keyword**
- whenever we change the state of globle variable on that time we don't need to use any keyword.

**Conditions**
- use if, else, revert, modifier and require statement conditions for testing, also use bool data type for returning boolean data type.



## Loops

**While lopp**
- learn syntex of while loop.


**do while lopp**
- learn syntex of do while loop.


**For loop**
- learn syntex of for loop.



## Hardhad Testing

**Writing code**
- learn about how to write test code using ether.js library usign hardhad for our solidity smart contract.

**Testing code**
- test the whole backend solidity project for test there backend api using hardhad and ether.js library.

**Deploying code**
- deploy our contract on testnet using hardhat and alkaimy for testing it in test network.
